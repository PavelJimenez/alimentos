1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons of milk <br>

                <p>for the bitumen</p>

                <p> preparation</p>
1. Preheat the oven to 180 ° C (350 ° F). Grease a mold for 12 muffins or liner with paper cups. <br>
2. Mix the flour very well with the baking powder and the salt in a medium bowl. <br>
3. In a separate bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until it is fluffy. While stirring, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. It incorporates vanilla. <br>
4. Add the powders to the previous mixture, alternating with the milk, and mixing until all the lumps are undone, but without over churning. <br>
5. Divide the dough between the prepared molds, filling them up to three quarters of their capacity. Add 1 tablespoon of dulce de leche to the center of each cupcake. It is not necessary that you try to cover cover since once the cake goes up, it will cover the filling by itself. Bake until they feel spongy to the touch, between 18 and 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool inside the molds for 10 minutes. Then unmold and place on wire racks to cool completely. <br>
6. Place the dulce de leche, cream cheese and vanilla in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until completely integrated. Put the bitumen inside a pastry bag with star duya, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Decorate the already cold cupcakes with this delicious bitumen cream cheese and cajeta. <br><br>
