            <p> Elaboration: </p>
1.Pre-heat the oven to 180ÂºC. Separate 6 egg whites from different bowls. Beat 6 egg whites to a nougat point with an electric mixer (it is very important that they remain on the nougat before adding the other ingredients), once they are added, add the sugar little by little while continuing to beat. <br>
2. Bake the 6 yolks with a fork and add them to the mixture. Add the flour and milk and beat until a homogeneous mixture is left. <br>
3. Brown and flour the mold you will use. Empty the mixture of the cake in the mold so that it is 3/4 full. Put it in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes (without opening the oven, always be watching it) or until a stick comes out clean. <br>
4.While you are baking, mix in the blender or the blender the three milks (condensed milk, evaporated milk and cream) and one yolk (the white one you should reserve for the bitumen) <br>
5. Once the cake is ready, remove it from the oven and while it is hot, chop it with a fork on all sides and add the mixture of the three milks. <br>
6.For the meringue: Beat 3 egg whites until stiff once you are adding glass sugar little by little. <br>
7. Once the cake is completely cold, decorate the cake with the meringue and strawberries. <br> <br>
