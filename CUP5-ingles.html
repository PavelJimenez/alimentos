                 <p>  Ingredients</p>
 100 gr of butter without salt <br>
 180 gr of sugar <br>
 2 eggs M <br>
 220 gr of flour <br>
 2 teaspoons of chemical yeast (Royal type) <br>
 120 ml semi-skimmed milk <br>
 150 gr of milk chocolate <br>
 2 large spoons of cocoa powder without sugar <br>
                  </div>
            <div class="divelaboracion">
                <p> Preparation</p>
1.Mix the unsalted butter, softened at room temperature, together with the sugar. This time I decided to add less amount of sugar than usual to balance the sweetness that also gives milk chocolate that has added this recipe. <br>
2.Then add the eggs and melted chocolate in the microwave. After beating a little more, it is time to add the flour, along with the yeast and cocoa powder. Finally add the milk. <br>
3.Beat a little more until the mixture is homogeneous and you have ready the dough to distribute in the capsules. <br>
4.Bake for 20-23 minutes at approximately 180ºC. <br>
5.This recipe is one of those that can become rebellious. The melted chocolate, not the one that we put in powder, makes the cake cost more to go up and made inside. <br>
6.To give you an idea, usually the cupcakes are made in my oven in 20 minutes EXACT at 170ºC, however, these took from 23 to 24 minutes. And, although they went up quite well, inside I got the feeling that they were a tad raw. <br>
7. I have already said many times, the times and temperatures that I put may vary slightly. You have to do tests in your own oven. <br>
8.When the baking time is over, take the cupcakes out of the oven, leave them in the mold for a few minutes, then cool them completely in a rack.<br><br>
