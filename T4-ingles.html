            <p> Ingredients </p>

100 grs cold butter cut into small cubes <br>
4 grs salt <br>
20 grs sugar <br>
1 tbsp milk <br>
1 egg <br>
1 cdita vanilla <br>
            
            <p>For the filling</p>
1 ½ cups of blackberries, choose the largest and most beautiful
200 grs of cream <br>
200 grs white chocolate (can be sparks, coverage, or bar cut into very small pieces) <br>
                  </div>

            <p>Elaboration</p>
            1.Preheat the oven to 180ºC / 350ºF. <br>
2. Grease generously with butter a cake mold with removable bottom. It can be smooth or curly. <br>
3.In the bowl of the blender with the blade, mix the flour, salt, sugar and butter at medium speed until the mass looks like wet sand and no pieces of butter are larger than a pea. Add the egg, milk and vanilla and mix quickly at low speed (10 to 15 seconds is enough). Transfer the dough to the work surface, and using the palms of the hand, rub the mixture against the surface to incorporate it into a single ball, quickly. It is important not to overwork the dough so as not to make it elastic and not to melt the butter. <br>
4.With the help of the roller, extend the dough to obtain a large circle of less than 1/2 cm high. Using the rolling pin, transfer the circle of dough to cover the mold of the cake, and press it lightly against the edges. Roll the roller over the mold to eliminate excess mass. To fill the cake with weight, use plastic film; extend a very long piece (there must be at least two hands on each side) vertically, and then another piece equally long horizontally, to obtain a cross. Fill the center of the cake with rice, beans, or metallic pastry weights. Close the edges of the plastic film leaving an air bubble inside. (This will shrink inside the oven, so it's important to leave room). <br>
5. Stir the cake for 15 minutes, until it looks dry and very lightly browned. Remove from the oven, remove the bag with weight, and return to bake for 5 to 10 minutes, until the center of the cake is dry and lightly browned. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. <br>
            <p>To make the ganache</p>
1. Place the white chocolate in a medium metal bowl and set aside. In a small saucepan, heat the cream until it reaches a very light boil (as soon as small bubbles appear on the surface, this list). Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and let stand for 5 minutes. The chocolate will melt with the heat of the cream. With a balloon, beat energetically until a homogeneous mixture remains, and no pieces of whole chocolate remain. <br>
2. Put the ganache inside the cake evenly. Place the blackberries carefully in a spiral or concentric circles. Let the ganache harden before cutting the cake, preferably in the fridge. <br><br>
